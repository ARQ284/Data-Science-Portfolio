# Data Science Portfolio

Please feel free to view and inquire about any of the above files.
There are both Python and R files, which contain samples of the types of analysis I am performing in my day-to-day work (although the subject matter here is outside of healthcare).
The notebooks consist of a mix of data visualization, aggregation, reshaping, statistical analysis, and machine learning models.
